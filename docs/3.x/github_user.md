# github_user

`github_user` represents the `vault_github_user` Terraform resource.



This package contains functions and utilities for setting up the resource using Jsonnet code.

## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new()
```


`vault.github_user.new` injects a new `vault_github_user` Terraform `resource`
block into the root module document.

Additionally, this inserts a private function into the `_ref` attribute that generates references to attributes of the
resource. For example, if you added a new instance to the root using:

    # arguments omitted for brevity
    vault.github_user.new('some_id')

You can get the reference to the `id` field of the created `vault.github_user` using the reference:

    $._ref.vault_github_user.some_id.get('id')

This is the same as directly entering `"${ vault_github_user.some_id.id }"` as the value.

NOTE: if you are chaining multiple resources together in a merge operation, you may not be able to use `super`, `self`,
or `$` to refer to the root object. Instead, make an explicit outer object using `local`.

**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block.
  - `backend` (`string`): Auth backend to which user mapping will be congigured. When `null`, the `backend` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `namespace` (`string`): Target namespace. (requires Enterprise) When `null`, the `namespace` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `policies` (`list`): Policies to be assigned to this user. When `null`, the `policies` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `user` (`string`): GitHub user name.

**Returns**:
- A mixin object that injects the new resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn newAttrs

```ts
newAttrs()
```


`vault.github_user.newAttrs` constructs a new object with attributes and blocks configured for the `github_user`
Terraform resource.

Unlike [vault.github_user.new](#fn-new), this function will not inject the `resource`
block into the root Terraform document. Instead, this must be passed in as the `attrs` argument for the
[tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) function to build a complete block.

This is most useful when you need to preprocess the attributes with functions, conditional, or looping logic prior to
injecting into a complete block.

**Args**:
  - `backend` (`string`): Auth backend to which user mapping will be congigured. When `null`, the `backend` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `namespace` (`string`): Target namespace. (requires Enterprise) When `null`, the `namespace` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `policies` (`list`): Policies to be assigned to this user. When `null`, the `policies` field will be omitted from the resulting object.
  - `user` (`string`): GitHub user name.

**Returns**:
  - An attribute object that can be used with [tf.withResource](https://github.com/tf-libsonnet/core/tree/main/docs#fn-withresource) to construct a new `github_user` resource into the root Terraform configuration.


### fn withBackend

```ts
withBackend()
```

`vault.string.withBackend` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the backend field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `backend` field.


### fn withNamespace

```ts
withNamespace()
```

`vault.string.withNamespace` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the namespace field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `namespace` field.


### fn withPolicies

```ts
withPolicies()
```

`vault.list.withPolicies` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `list`
Terraform resource block to set or update the policies field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`list`): The value to set for the `policies` field.


### fn withUser

```ts
withUser()
```

`vault.string.withUser` constructs a mixin object that can be merged into the `string`
Terraform resource block to set or update the user field.



**Args**:
  - `resourceLabel` (`string`): The name label of the block to update.
  - `value` (`string`): The value to set for the `user` field.
